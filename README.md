### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Trevor Baughn, a game developer currently based in the Greater Seattle Area.  I work as a designer and programmer professionally, but like to do a bit of everything for my hobby projects.  My repos here include a lot as well, though nothing really useful for the general public.  No packages or anything.  That might change one day.
