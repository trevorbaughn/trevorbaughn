### Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm Trevor Baughn, a game developer currently based in the Greater Seattle Area. I generally try to keep things as open-source as possible. Here you'll find several prototypes and small games. Many of these were done during a period of time where I made a game each week in ~10 hours. Some of them are 48-hour game jams (most of which I collaborated with others for). There are even a couple Discord bots in here.
